# OWASP Top 10

The **OWASP Top 10** is a globally recognized list of the **most critical security risks** in web applications. Published by the **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)**, it provides organizations with a prioritized list of vulnerabilities that developers, security teams, and businesses should address to improve application security.

## 2021 Edition

Here are the **10 most critical web application security risks** according to OWASP:

| Rank | Risk                                       | Description                                                                            |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Broken Access Control                      | Unauthorized users gain access to restricted functions or data.                        |
| 2    | Cryptographic Failures                     | Weak or improper use of encryption, exposing sensitive data.                           |
| 3    | Injection                                  | Malicious code is injected into an application (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, OS, LDAP injection). |
| 4    | Insecure Design                            | Flaws in application architecture or design that lead to security weaknesses.          |
| 5    | Security Misconfiguration                  | Default or improperly configured security settings.                                    |
| 6    | Vulnerable and Outdated Components         | Use of outdated libraries, frameworks, or dependencies with known vulnerabilities.     |
| 7    | Identification and Authentication Failures | Weak authentication mechanisms (e.g., brute force attacks, session hijacking).         |
| 8    | Software and Data Integrity Failures       | Code or infrastructure tampering due to lack of integrity checks.                      |
| 9    | Security Logging and Monitoring Failures   | Insufficient logging or monitoring, delaying incident detection.                       |
| 10   | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)         | Attackers force the server to make unauthorized requests to internal systems.          |
