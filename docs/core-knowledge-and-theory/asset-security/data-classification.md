# Data Classification

**Data Classification** is the systematic process of categorizing data based on its sensitivity, value, and criticality to the organization. It's the cornerstone of information security that determines what data needs protection and to what extent.

## Why Data Classification Matters

- **Identify sensitive information** requiring protection
- **Apply appropriate security controls** based on data sensitivity
- **Ensure compliance** with regulatory requirements
- **Facilitate data handling** procedures
- **Optimize security spending** by focusing resources on critical data
- **Establish clear ownership** and accountability for data assets

## Common Data Classification Levels

Data classification typically involves categorizing data into levels based on its sensitivity. Here are some common classification levels:

| Classification Level | Description                                                                                        | Examples                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public               | Data that can be freely shared with anyone without risk to the organization.                       | Press releases, public website content, marketing materials.                                 |
| Internal             | Data intended for use within the organization but not sensitive enough to cause harm if disclosed. | Internal memos, employee directories, non-sensitive operational data.                        |
| Confidential         | Data that could cause harm to the organization or individuals if disclosed without authorization.  | Customer records, financial reports, proprietary business information.                       |
| Restricted           | Highly sensitive data that requires the highest level of protection.                               | Trade secrets, personally identifiable information (PII), classified government information. |
