# Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

**Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** is a **publicly available database** that provides a **standardized identifier** for known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is assigned a unique **CVE ID** (e.g., CVE-2024-1234), making it easier for organizations to track, prioritize, and mitigate risks.

CVE is maintained by the **MITRE Corporation** and is a critical resource for cybersecurity professionals, vendors, and organizations worldwide.

## Why is CVE Important?

- **Standardization:** Provides a universal naming convention for vulnerabilities, avoiding confusion.
- **Collaboration:** Enables vendors, researchers, and organizations to share information about vulnerabilities.
- **Prioritization:** Helps organizations identify and address critical vulnerabilities quickly.
- **Compliance:** Supports regulatory requirements (e.g., patch management, risk assessments).
- **Awareness:** Keeps the cybersecurity community informed about emerging threats.

## How CVE Works

- **Discovery:** A vulnerability is identified by researchers, vendors, or security teams.
- **Assignment:** MITRE or a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) assigns a unique CVE ID.
- **Publication:** The CVE entry is published in the CVE database.
- **Mitigation:** Organizations use CVE data to apply patches or implement workarounds.

## CVE ID Format

A CVE ID follows a standardized format: CVE-YYYY-NNNNN

- **CVE:** Prefix for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.
- **YYYY:** Year the vulnerability was assigned.
- **NNNNN:** Unique sequential number.

## CVE vs. CVSS

- **CVE:** Provides a unique identifier for a vulnerability.
- **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):** Assigns a severity score (0-10) to a CVE, based on factors like exploitability and impact.
