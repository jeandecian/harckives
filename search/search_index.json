It's the cornerstone of information security that determines what data needs protection and to what extent. Why Data Classification Matters Identify sensitive information requiring protection Apply appropriate security controls based on data sensitivity Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements Facilitate data handling procedures Optimize security spending by focusing resources on critical data Establish clear ownership and accountability for data assets Common Data Classification Levels Data classification typically involves categorizing data into levels based on its sensitivity. Here are some common classification levels: Classification Level Description Examples Public Data that can be freely shared with anyone without risk to the organization. Press releases, public website content, marketing materials. Internal Data intended for use within the organization but not sensitive enough to cause harm if disclosed. Internal memos, employee directories, non-sensitive operational data. Confidential Data that could cause harm to the organization or individuals if disclosed without authorization. Customer records, financial reports, proprietary business information. Restricted Highly sensitive data that requires the highest level of protection.

Confidentiality Definition: Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals, systems, or processes. Prevents unauthorized disclosure. Core Question: \"Who should have access to this information?\" Example Threats: Data breaches, eavesdropping, unauthorized access Integrity Definition: Maintaining the accuracy, completeness, and trustworthiness of information throughout its lifecycle. Prevents unauthorized modification. Core Question: \"Can we trust this information hasn't been altered?\" Example Threats: Data tampering, unauthorized changes, malware infection Availability Definition: Ensuring information and systems are accessible and usable by authorized users when needed. Core Question: \"Can authorized users access this when they need it?\" Example Threats: Denial-of-Service attacks, hardware failures, natural disasters The Balancing Act: Security professionals must often make trade-offs between these principles. For example: Strong encryption (Confidentiality) may impact system performance (Availability) Strict change controls (Integrity) might delay critical security patches Complex authentication (Confidentiality) could create access barriers during emergencies The DAD Triad: The Adversarial Perspective The DAD Triad (Disclosure, Alteration, Destruction) represents the inverse of CIA, the primary goals of attackers or negative outcomes of security failures. It's a valuable tool for threat modeling and understanding what you're defending against.

Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into a format that is unreadable to unauthorized users. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation of data, both at rest and in transit. Core Objectives of Cryptography Confidentiality: Ensures only authorized parties can access the information. Integrity: Guarantees that data has not been altered or tampered with. Authentication: Verifies the identity of users or systems. Non-repudiation: Prevents individuals from denying their actions (e.g., sending a message or transaction). Key Cryptographic Concepts Plaintext vs. Ciphertext Plaintext: Original, readable data. Ciphertext: Encrypted data, unreadable without decryption. Encryption and Decryption Encryption: Converts plaintext to ciphertext using an algorithm and a key. Decryption: Converts ciphertext back to plaintext using the same or a different key. Keys Symmetric Key: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES, DES). Asymmetric Key: Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption (e.g., RSA, ECC). Hashing Converts data into a fixed-length string (hash value) for integrity checks (e.g., SHA-256, MD5). Common Cryptographic Algorithms Type Algorithm Use Case Symmetric Encryption AES, 3DES, Blowfish Encrypting data at rest or in transit Asymmetric Encryption RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman Secure key exchange, digital signatures Hashing SHA-256, SHA-3, MD5 Data integrity, password storage","title":"Cryptography"},{"location":"core-knowledge-and-theory/security-architecture-and-engineering/cryptography/#cryptography","text":"","title":"Cryptography"},{"location":"core-knowledge-and-theory/security-architecture-and-engineering/cryptography/#what-is-cryptography","text":"Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into a format that is unreadable to unauthorized users.
