They help cybersecurity professionals design, troubleshoot, and secure networks by defining how data is transmitted, routed, and received across systems. OSI Model: 7 Layers The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes network functions into seven layers. Each layer has a specific role and interacts with the layers directly above and below it. Layer Name Function Security Considerations Layer 7 Application Provides network services to end-user applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP). Vulnerabilities in protocols (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). Layer 6 Presentation Translates data between the application layer and the network (e.g., encryption, compression). Data integrity, encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL). Layer 5 Session Manages sessions/connections between applications (e.g., NetBIOS, RPC). Session hijacking, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Layer 4 Transport Ensures end-to-end communication and data integrity (e.g., TCP, UDP). Port scanning, SYN floods, packet sniffing. Layer 3 Network Handles routing and forwarding of data packets (e.g., IP, ICMP, routers). IP spoofing, routing attacks, DDoS. Layer 2 Data Link Manages data framing and physical addressing (e.g., MAC addresses, switches, Ethernet). MAC flooding, ARP spoofing, VLAN hopping. Layer 1 Physical Transmits raw bit streams over physical media (e.g., cables, hubs, repeaters). Physical tampering, eavesdropping, cable tapping. TCP/IP Model: 4 Layers The TCP/IP model is the practical implementation of the OSI model, used in modern networks (e.g., the Internet). It consolidates the OSI layers into four layers. Layer Name Function Security Considerations Layer 4 Application Combines OSI Layers 5-7. Handles high-level protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS, SSH). Application-layer attacks (e.g., DDoS, malware). Layer 3 Transport Combines OSI Layer 4. Ensures data delivery (e.g., TCP, UDP). Port scanning, SYN attacks, packet injection. Layer 2 Internet Combines OSI Layer 3. Handles addressing and routing (e.g., IP, ICMP). IP spoofing, routing attacks, fragmentation attacks. Layer 1 Network Access Combines OSI Layers 1-2. Manages physical and data link functions (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi). MAC spoofing, ARP poisoning, physical attacks.

Confidentiality Definition: Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals, systems, or processes. Prevents unauthorized disclosure. Core Question: \"Who should have access to this information?\" Example Threats: Data breaches, eavesdropping, unauthorized access Integrity Definition: Maintaining the accuracy, completeness, and trustworthiness of information throughout its lifecycle. Prevents unauthorized modification. Core Question: \"Can we trust this information hasn't been altered?\" Example Threats: Data tampering, unauthorized changes, malware infection Availability Definition: Ensuring information and systems are accessible and usable by authorized users when needed. Core Question: \"Can authorized users access this when they need it?\" Example Threats: Denial-of-Service attacks, hardware failures, natural disasters The Balancing Act: Security professionals must often make trade-offs between these principles. For example: Strong encryption (Confidentiality) may impact system performance (Availability) Strict change controls (Integrity) might delay critical security patches Complex authentication (Confidentiality) could create access barriers during emergencies The DAD Triad: The Adversarial Perspective The DAD Triad (Disclosure, Alteration, Destruction) represents the inverse of CIA, the primary goals of attackers or negative outcomes of security failures.

Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into a format that is unreadable to unauthorized users. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation of data, both at rest and in transit. Core Objectives of Cryptography Confidentiality: Ensures only authorized parties can access the information. Integrity: Guarantees that data has not been altered or tampered with. Authentication: Verifies the identity of users or systems. Non-repudiation: Prevents individuals from denying their actions (e.g., sending a message or transaction). Key Cryptographic Concepts Plaintext vs. Ciphertext Plaintext: Original, readable data. Ciphertext: Encrypted data, unreadable without decryption. Encryption and Decryption Encryption: Converts plaintext to ciphertext using an algorithm and a key. Decryption: Converts ciphertext back to plaintext using the same or a different key. Keys Symmetric Key: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES, DES). Asymmetric Key: Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption (e.g., RSA, ECC). Hashing Converts data into a fixed-length string (hash value) for integrity checks (e.g., SHA-256, MD5). Common Cryptographic Algorithms Type Algorithm Use Case Symmetric Encryption AES, 3DES, Blowfish Encrypting data at rest or in transit Asymmetric Encryption RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman Secure key exchange, digital signatures Hashing SHA-256, SHA-3, MD5 Data integrity, password storage","title":"Cryptography"},{"location":"core-knowledge-and-theory/security-architecture-and-engineering/cryptography/#cryptography","text":"","title":"Cryptography"},{"location":"core-knowledge-and-theory/security-architecture-and-engineering/cryptography/#what-is-cryptography","text":"Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into a format that is unreadable to unauthorized users.
