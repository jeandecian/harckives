They help cybersecurity professionals design, troubleshoot, and secure networks by defining how data is transmitted, routed, and received across systems. OSI Model: 7 Layers The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes network functions into seven layers. Each layer has a specific role and interacts with the layers directly above and below it. Layer Name Function Security Considerations Layer 7 Application Provides network services to end-user applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP). Vulnerabilities in protocols (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). Layer 6 Presentation Translates data between the application layer and the network (e.g., encryption, compression). Data integrity, encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL). Layer 5 Session Manages sessions/connections between applications (e.g., NetBIOS, RPC). Session hijacking, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Layer 4 Transport Ensures end-to-end communication and data integrity (e.g., TCP, UDP). Port scanning, SYN floods, packet sniffing. Layer 3 Network Handles routing and forwarding of data packets (e.g., IP, ICMP, routers). IP spoofing, routing attacks, DDoS. Layer 2 Data Link Manages data framing and physical addressing (e.g., MAC addresses, switches, Ethernet). MAC flooding, ARP spoofing, VLAN hopping. Layer 1 Physical Transmits raw bit streams over physical media (e.g., cables, hubs, repeaters). Physical tampering, eavesdropping, cable tapping. TCP/IP Model: 4 Layers The TCP/IP model is the practical implementation of the OSI model, used in modern networks (e.g., the Internet). It consolidates the OSI layers into four layers. Layer Name Function Security Considerations Layer 4 Application Combines OSI Layers 5-7. Handles high-level protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS, SSH). Application-layer attacks (e.g., DDoS, malware). Layer 3 Transport Combines OSI Layer 4. Ensures data delivery (e.g., TCP, UDP). Port scanning, SYN attacks, packet injection. Layer 2 Internet Combines OSI Layer 3. Handles addressing and routing (e.g., IP, ICMP). IP spoofing, routing attacks, fragmentation attacks. Layer 1 Network Access Combines OSI Layers 1-2.

It ensures that only authorized users and processes have the appropriate level of access. Below are the primary types of access control models , each with its own approach to managing permissions. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) DAC allows the owner of a resource (e.g., file, folder) to decide who can access it and what permissions they have. Access is granted at the discretion of the owner. Key Characteristics of DAC Flexible: Owners can freely grant or revoke access. User-Centric: Users control access to their own resources. Example: File permissions in Windows (e.g., sharing a folder with specific users). Mandatory Access Control (MAC) MAC is a strict, policy-driven model where access is determined by a central authority (e.g., system administrator or security policy). Users and processes cannot change access permissions. Key Characteristics of MAC Rule-Based: Access is granted based on predefined rules (e.g., security clearance levels). Hierarchical: Uses labels (e.g., \"Top Secret,\" \"Confidential\") to classify resources and users. Example: Military or government systems (e.g., Bell-LaPadula model). Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) RBAC grants access based on user roles (e.g., \"Admin,\" \"Editor,\" \"Viewer\"). Permissions are assigned to roles, and users inherit permissions based on their role. Key Characteristics of RBAC Scalable: Simplifies permission management in large organizations. Role Assignment: Users are assigned roles, not individual permissions. Example: Enterprise systems (e.g., Active Directory, AWS IAM). Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) ABAC grants access based on attributes (e.g., user attributes, resource attributes, environmental conditions). Uses policies like \"If (user.department = 'Finance' AND resource.type = 'Budget'), then grant access.\" Key Characteristics of ABAC Dynamic: Access decisions are context-aware. Fine-Grained: Allows for highly specific access rules. Example: Modern cloud services (e.g., AWS IAM policies). Rule-Based Access Control (RuBAC) RuBAC grants access based on predefined rules (e.g., time of day, location). Similar to MAC but often used for specific scenarios (e.g., \"Allow access only during business hours\"). Key Characteristics of RuBAC Conditional: Access is granted based on rules. Example: Firewall rules, network access control lists (ACLs). Choosing the Right Model For simplicity: Use DAC or RuBAC. For scalability: Use RBAC. For granularity: Use ABAC. For high security: Use MAC.","title":"Access Control Models"},{"location":"core-knowledge-and-theory/identity-and-access-management-iam/access-control-models/#access-control-models","text":"Access control is a core security principle that determines who or what can view, use, or modify resources in a system.

Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into a format that is unreadable to unauthorized users. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation of data, both at rest and in transit. Core Objectives of Cryptography Confidentiality: Ensures only authorized parties can access the information. Integrity: Guarantees that data has not been altered or tampered with. Authentication: Verifies the identity of users or systems. Non-repudiation: Prevents individuals from denying their actions (e.g., sending a message or transaction). Key Cryptographic Concepts Plaintext vs. Ciphertext Plaintext: Original, readable data. Ciphertext: Encrypted data, unreadable without decryption. Encryption and Decryption Encryption: Converts plaintext to ciphertext using an algorithm and a key. Decryption: Converts ciphertext back to plaintext using the same or a different key. Keys Symmetric Key: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES, DES). Asymmetric Key: Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption (e.g., RSA, ECC). Hashing Converts data into a fixed-length string (hash value) for integrity checks (e.g., SHA-256, MD5).

CVE is maintained by the MITRE Corporation and is a critical resource for cybersecurity professionals, vendors, and organizations worldwide. Why is CVE Important? Standardization: Provides a universal naming convention for vulnerabilities, avoiding confusion. Collaboration: Enables vendors, researchers, and organizations to share information about vulnerabilities. Prioritization: Helps organizations identify and address critical vulnerabilities quickly. Compliance: Supports regulatory requirements (e.g., patch management, risk assessments). Awareness: Keeps the cybersecurity community informed about emerging threats. How CVE Works Discovery: A vulnerability is identified by researchers, vendors, or security teams. Assignment: MITRE or a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) assigns a unique CVE ID. Publication: The CVE entry is published in the CVE database. Mitigation: Organizations use CVE data to apply patches or implement workarounds. CVE ID Format A CVE ID follows a standardized format: CVE-YYYY-NNNNN CVE: Prefix for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. YYYY: Year the vulnerability was assigned. NNNNN: Unique sequential number.
